# Latex-Template-Doctoral-Dissertation-EastChinaNormalUniversity
华东师范大学博士论文latex模板

I had the idea to set up a project at GitHub in early 2017 when I was preparing
my doctoral dissertation at East China Normal University (ECNU). 

Benifiting from one of my friends--Dr. Yuguang Zhang's contribution, I made a
latex tempelate for doctoral dissdertation of ECNU. I wrote my thesis entitled
"钙钛矿氧化物异质结中金属—绝缘体相变和电子输运的理论研究" using this template,
I hope it can be applied into more doctoral dissertations, and I am also
confident that many PhD students will be glad to use it.

Anyone who needs this template can use and modify it freely under the license, 
and I will be grateful if you can acknowledge or cite my project in your thesis
like this:
论文模板来自于方跃文的GitHub项目——华东师范大学博士论文latex模板 (

)


It is also highly encuraged that other contributors can refine this template.


Although Dr. Yuguang Zhang didn't take part in this project directly, I still would
like to list him as one of the authors of this latex template project owning to his large contributions.
